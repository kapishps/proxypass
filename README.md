The important thing is to understand that bruteforce and Dictionary attack programs are very easy to make therefore it is always advised to keep long strong passwords.

For eg:-
For an alphanumeric password of length 8 characters even with 10000 pings/sec it would take 9 years to search all possible values

####This repo contains python scripts which demonstrate basic bruteforce attack on proxy server with basic authentication.

The whole process is done in 3 steps
+ create a dictionary of words from letters/numbers
+ extract username from html doc
+ use username and pass from above two steps and ping proxy server with login credentials.
